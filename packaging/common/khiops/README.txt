Khiops is a fully automatic tool for mining large multi-table databases,
winner of several data mining challenges.

Khiops components
  - Khiops: supervised analysis (classification, regression) and correlation study
  - Khiops Visualization: to visualize data preparation, modeling and evaluation results of Khiops
  - Khiops Coclustering: exploratory analysis using hierarchical coclustering
  - Khiops Covisualization: to visualize, explore and annotate coclustering results

Main features
  - fully automatic data preparation (variable construction and preprocessing) and modeling
  - mining of data with single table and multi-table schemas
  - data preparation and modeling for classification, irrespective of the number of classes
  - data preparation and modeling for regression
  - descriptive statistics as well as correlation analysis for unsupervised data exploration
  - advanced unsupervised analysis via coclustering
  - enhanced recoding capabilities for data preparation
  - post-evaluation of trained predictors
  - robustness and scalability, with multi-gigabytes train datasets and no deployment limit
  - parallelization of data management, data preparation, modeling and deployment tasks
  - ease of use via simple user interface
  - interactive visualization tools for easily interpretable results
  - easy integration in information systems via batch mode, python library and
    online deployment library

Khiops 11 - what's new
  - Text data:
    - new Text type for variables in tabular or multi-table schema
    - Automatic feature construction from Text variables

  - SNB classifier for sparse data: extension to sparse data

  - Random forests for regression

  - Khiops interpretation and reinforcement:
    - Instance-based interpretation of scores
    - Exact computation of Shapley values
    - Importance of SNB selected variables is now computing using their mean absolute Shapley value
    - Build an interpretation dictionary, to deploy interpretation values
    - Build a reinforcement dictionary, to deploy reinforcement scores based on lever variables

  - Histograms: Optimal histograms for univariate data exploration

  - Coclustering instances x variables: extension of existing variable x variable coclustering, for joint density estimation to instances x variables coclustering, for exploratory analysis.

  - Visualization tools:
    - visualization: new panel to visualize histograms
    - covisualization: accounting for the case of instances x variables coclustering

  - Simplified ergonomy
    - simplification of panels and fields, everywhere, as much as possible
    - fast path: to train a model without a dictionary
    - results visualization and edition of dictionaries from the graphical interface

  - Extended scenario-based management of Khiops, with control structures and a parameter file in JSON format
