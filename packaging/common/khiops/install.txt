1.1 Installation process on Windows
----------------------------------

The steps to download and use Khiops are summarized below.

Step 1 - On www.khiops.com
. Go to the "Login" page and log in

Step 2 - On www.khiops.com
. Go to the "Install" page
. Download the Khiops version that you need (Windows or Linux)

Step 3 - On your computer: install Khiops in administrator mode
  
1.2 Known problems on Windows
-----------------------------
The Khiops installer relies on embedded installers for Java and MPI.
  - Windows Defender or any other antivirus software may remove excutable files (.exe, .jar) during installation.
    In this case, you should add exceptions to your antivirus or disable it during installation.
  - The java installer results in a system reboot on some systems (eg. on Windows Server 2008)
  - The MPI installer is Microsoft MPI 10, which is not compliant with too old Windows OS.
    If necessary, the khiops.cmd command file can be edited to start Khiops without MPI
    (see khiops_coclustering.cmd)

Khiops comes with three packages: khiops-core, khiops and khiops-samples. khiops-core is a lightweight package without GUI, 
documentation or samples. It is intended to be used on servers and dockers. The khiops package requires 
khiops-core and contains the full version of Khiops: GUI, documentation. The khiops-samples contains several datasets used in 
Khiops tutorial. These samples are located in /opt/khiops/samples. This directory is write protected, therefore,
in order to work with it, it is recommended to copy it to your home directory (or /tmp).

In the same way, KNI comes with two packages: kni and kni-doc. kni contains only the header and the shared 
library of Khiops native interface. And kni-doc contains the documentation and samples.

2.1 Important Warnings for Linux users
---------------------------------------
With khiops-core or on remote machines without X tunneling, khiops and khiops_coclustering must 
be executed with the "-b" option. Otherwise, Khiops tries to launch a Java GUI, causing a Java error 
("fatal error : Java GUI : No GUI (X server) available under current environment").
 
2.2 Installation process on Linux
----------------------------------
The installation process is the same as on Windows (see section 1.1). There are nevertheless some 
differences. If you are using a linux repository, the installation of the khiops package will 
automatically install khiops-core and khiops-samples packages. It is more complicated if you download the packages: 
you have to install khiops-core before khiops. 

On debian :

sudo dpkg -i khiops-core_10.1-0+focal_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i khiops-samples_10.1-0+focal_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i khiops_10.1-0+focal_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get -f install

On redhat :

sudo yum localinstall khiops-core-10.1-0.el7.x86_64.rpm
sudo yum localinstall khiops-samples-10.1-0.el7.x86_64.rpm
sudo yum localinstall khiops-10.1-0.el7.x86_64.rpm

2.3 Known problems on Linux
---------------------------
 - A bug on openjdk on Ubuntu 18.04 causes a java exception. 
   To fix this problem, you have to edit the file 
   /etc/java-11-openjdk/accessibility.properties and comment the line 
   "assistive_technologies=org.GNOME.Accessibility.AtkWrapper"
 - When there is a problem resolving localhost, khiops fails with an MPICH error endind with :
   ckpt_restart(379)..................: gethostbyname failed, YOUR_LOCAL_HOST_NAME (errno 1)
   This issue appears when the command "localhost" and the file /etc/hosts are not consistent
   To solve this issue, type "sudo hostnamectl set-hostname NEW-NAME" where NEW-NAME is 
   the hostname of /etc/hosts
 - On some Raspbian release, the java GUI is freezing. However, you can use Khiops in
   batch mode (khiops -b) or with the python library.
