Version 10.1
============
Khiops 10.1 is a minor release, with few new features, but many optimization and reliability
improvements, to better perform in cloud environments and better integrate Khiops within information
systems.

Main new features
- Visualization tools:
  - Khiops visualization: new panel "Tree preparation" to visualize the trees.
  - Khiops covisualization: new tool, replacing the previous one based on the obsolete Flex
    framework.
- Data Table Dictionaries:
  - A new type TimestampTZ: A timestamp with timezone:
    - it uses the ISO 8601 standard (see the Khiops Guide for more details).
    - it is detected automatically in the "Build dictionary from data table" feature.
    - new derivation rules for this type:
      - CopyTSTZ, FormatTimestampTZ, AsTimestampTZ, UtcTimestamp, LocalTimestamp,
        SetTimeZoneMinutes, GetTimeZoneMinutes, DiffTimestampTZ, AddSecondsTSTZ, IsTimestampTZValid,
        BuildTimestampTZ, GetValueTSTZ.
    - new automatic construction rule in "Variable construction parameters":
      - LocalTimestamp, to obtain a local Timestamp from a TimestampTZ
  - Timestamp type now accepts a format with the character 'T' as separator between date and time.
  - New derivation rules for ternary operator rules: IfD, IfT, IfTS, IfTSTZ.
- Sample percentage field in all database dialog boxes now accepts one digit precision (ex: 2.5%).
- Coclustering simplification now accepts a new constraint: the maximum total part number.

Main integration improvements
- License keys/tokens are not required anymore to execute Khiops:
  - Note that Khiops is not unlicensed, having the same legal license agreement file as before.
  - The options -l and -u of the Khiops executables are not available anymore.
- Log, progression and output scenario files can now be redirected to /dev/stdout or /dev/stderr on Linux,
  with lines prefixed by the string "Khiops.log", "Khiops.progression" and  Khiops.command respectively.
- A new format for progression files that is simpler and easier to parse.
- New executable return codes:
  - 1 if there were fatal errors in the execution
  - 2 if there were errors but no fatal errors in the execution
  - 0 on success
- A new environment variable KHIOPS_RAW_GUI allows file name selection for URIs; it disables the
  file chooser dialog box in the user interface (see khiops_env command file in Khiops bin directory).
- A data table file format detection more resilient to empty lines among valid lines.
- Khiops now accepts UTF-8 data table files with BOM (byte order mark).
- Less verbose log files.

Main performance improvements
- Tree construction is now parallelized.
- Quantile sampling in multi-table tasks is now parallelized.
- More exact resource estimations, eliminating previous overestimations and execution refusals.
- The I/O lower layers have been deeply refactored, to better perform in cloud environments.

Many minor corrections, mainly for edge-case bugs.


Version 10.0.4
==============
- bug fix in sort algorithm : the field separator in the output file was not correct for files with
  a huge number of identical lines.


Version 10.0.3
==============
- fix an edge-case bug in multi-table schemas, in case of a root table of moderate size and several
  subtables, some of them very small and some very large, and duplicate records in the root table

- fix a problem of wrong line numbers reported in case or warning or errors occuring with very large
  data files

- fix a bug in json reports for trees

- the file format detector is now more resilient to empty lines in the analyzed data files


Version 10.0.2
==============
- fix a bug for file systems with URI schemes (s3 or hdfs) for correct managment of the "result
  files directory"


Version 10.0.1
==============
Improvements:
- better handling of database encodings (ascii, ansi, utf8) for json report files, to make it easier
  to manipulate reports from pykhiops:
  cf. "Character encodings" section in the Khiops guide

- the "Detect file format" feature now displays a message in the log window with the recognized
  format: used header line and field separator

- the "Build dictionary" function now proposes a categorical format for fields that only contain the
  values "", "0", or "1"

- in modeling dictionaries, the target variable is now set as "Unused" by default to facilitate the
  deployment of predictors in the case of deployment databases where the target variable is missing

- the Accidents sample database is now translated into English, with interpretable variable names
  and values; a simpler version called AccidentsSummary is available

- the khiops and khiops_coclustering shell commands now exploit a common shell command khiops_env
  which defines all env variables required by Khiops. This new command is self-documented and can
  be used from a wrapper, such as pykhiops

- better messages and documentation in case of unsupported data formats, such as the "classic" Mac
  OS line endings, deprecated since Max OS X in 1998, or a UTF-8 file with BOM (byte order mark)
  start characters

- slight improvement of the level criterion for the preparation of univariate and bivariate data in
  some edge cases

- the "Build coclustering" button is renamed to "Train coclustering" in the Khiops coclustering tool

- the environment variables for managing external resources are now KHIOPS_MEMORY_LIMIT and
  KHIOPS_TMP_DIR, instead of the now obsolete KhiopsTmpDir.

- AUC is now 0 in the case of an empty test database.

- the "Specific test database" dialog is now reset when the test database mode has changed.

- other minor improvements


Issues:
- fix a bug in the "Extract keys" function, when the output file is specified without a header line

- fix an overestimation of the memory requirement for building the trees in the case of large
  databases

- fix a edge case bug that freezes parallel processes when learning a multi-table scheme

- fix a edge case bug in the SNB classifier, in the case of a very large matrix instances x
  variables beyond two billion values

- fix a edge case bug in the sorting functionality, when the input files contain fields between
  double quotes with internal quotes double quotes and/or an input field separator, and when the
  output field separator is different from the input one

- fix a bug in te user interface, when the "Inspect dictionary" action could be called twice
  simultaneously, resulting in a crash

- fix several resource management issues in the case of a cluster with several heteregeneous
  machines

- Other minor corrections

Backwards compatibility with Khiops 9
  - dictionaries of Khiops 9 are readable with Khiops 10
  - visualization reports of Khiops 9 are usable with the former visualization tool
  - python scripts using pykhiops 9 are running, with warnings for the deprecated features

    it is preferable to use python scripts using pykhiops


Detailed evolutions
===================
Predictor
  - the new SNB algorithm directly optimizes the variable weights instead of computing
    them as a weighted sum over an ensemble of models,
  - the new SNB algorithm selects far less variables than previously
     - the MAP Naive Bayes predictor is no longer available
     - the Naive Bayes predictor is no longer available
  - in the SNB modeling report, each selected variable comes with three indicators
     - level: univariate evaluation
     - weight: multivariate evaluation
     - importance (new indicator): geometric mean of the weight and the level
     - the MAP indicator is no longer available
  - regression: predictors can now deal with missing target values
     - modeling: predictor are trained on the subset of the train database,
       containing the records related to actual target values
     - evaluation: the evaluation criteria are computed using only the
       the records related to actual target values

Management of sparse data:
  - user impacts, in the user interface
    - in the deployment dialog box, the user can choose the output format for the output database:
       - tabular (default): standard tabular format
       - sparse: extended tabular format, with sparse fields in case of sparse data
  - technical impacts, most of them for internal purpose only,
    sparse data is managed throughout the data mining process,
    from feature construction to model deployment
    - dictionaries: variables can be organized in blocks of sparse variables
    - file format: sparse format is exploited in case of blocks of variables
    - derivation rules: many internal sparse derivation rules have been added
