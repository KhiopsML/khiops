Khiops Native Interface @PROJECT_VERSION@
==============================

The purpose of Khiops Native Interface (KNI) is to allow a deeper integration
of Khiops in information systems, by mean of the C programming language, using
a dynamic link library (DLL). This relates specially to the problem of model
deployment, which otherwise requires the use of input and output data files
when using directly the Khiops tool in batch mode. See Khiops Guide for an
introduction to dictionary files, dictionaries, database files and deployment.

The Khiops deployment features are thus made public through an API with a DLL.
Therefore, a Khiops model can be deployed directly from any programming
language, such as C, C++, Java, Python, Matlab, etc. This enables real time
model deployment without the overhead of temporary data files or launching
executables. This is critical for certain applications in marketing or targeted
advertising on the web.

All KNI functions are C functions for easy use with other programming languages.
They return a positive or null value in case of success, and a negative error
code in case of failure. The functions are not reentrant (thread-safe): the DLL
can be used simultaneously by several executables, but not simultaneously by
several threads in the same executable.

See KhiopsNativeInterface.h for a detailed description of KNI functions
