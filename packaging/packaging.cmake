set(CPACK_COMPONENT_KHIOPS_DESCRIPTION
    "software for data mining
Khiops is a data preparation and scoring tool for supervised learning
and unsupervised learning. It allows one to perform univariate and
bivariate descriptive statistics, to evaluate the predictive
importance of explanatory variables, to discretize numerical
variables, to group the values of categorical variables, to recode
input data according to these discretizations and value groupings. It
allows one to perform multi-table relational mining with automatic
variable construction. Khiops also produces a scoring model for
supervised learning tasks, according to a Selective Naive Bayes
approach, either for classification or for regression.  Khiops is
available both in user interface mode and in batch mode, such that it
can easily be embedded as a software component in a data mining
deployment projet.")

Khiops is a data preparation and scoring tool for supervised learning and

.
This package is a minimal Khiops package, it contains the minimal files and
dependancies to use Khiops. It is intended to be used on servers : it comes
without GUI, samples or documentation. The full Khiops distribution is
available with the 'khiops' package.")

set(CPACK_COMPONENT_KNI_DESCRIPTION
    "Khiops Native Interface
The purpose of Khiops Native Interface (KNI) is to allow a deep integration of
Khiops in information systems, by the mean of the C programming language, using
a dynamic link library (DLL). This relates especially to the problem of model
deployment, which otherwise requires the use of input and output data files
when using directly the Khiops tool in batch mode. See Khiops Guide for an
introduction to dictionary files, dictionaries, database files and deployment.
.
The Khiops deployment features are thus made public through an API with a DLL.
Therefore, a Khiops model can be deployed directly from any programming
language, such as C, C++, Java, Python, Matlab... This enables model deployment
in real time application (e.g. scoring in a marketing context,targeted
advertising on the web) without the overhead of temporary data files or
launching executables.
.
All KNI functions are C functions for easier use with other programming
languages. They return a positive or null value in case of success, and a
negative error code in case of failure. The functions are not reentrant
(thread-safe): the DLL can be used simultaneously by several executables, but
not simultaneously by several threads in the same executable.
.
See KhiopsNativeInterface.h for a detailed description of KNI functions")
