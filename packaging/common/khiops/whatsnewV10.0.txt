Khiops 10.0.4 release notes
===========================
. bug fix in sort algorithm : the field separator in the output file was not correct 
  for files with a huge number of identical lines.
  

Khiops 10.0.3 release notes
===========================
. fix an edge-case bug in multi-table schemas, in case of a root table of moderate size
  and several subtables, some of them very small and some very large, and duplicate records
  in the root table

. fix a problem of wrong line numbers reported in case or warning or errors occuring
  with very large data files

. fix a bug in json reports for trees

. the file format detector is now more resilient to empty lines in the analyzed data files


Khiops 10.0.2 release notes
===========================
. fix a bug for file systems with URI schemes (s3 or hdfs) for correct managment
   of the "result files directory"


Khiops 10.0.1 release notes
===========================
Improvements:
. better handling of database encodings (ascii, ansi, utf8) for json report files,
  to make it easier to manipulate reports from pykhiops:
  cf. "Character encodings" section in the Khiops guide

. the "Detect file format" feature now displays a message in the log window
  with the recognized format: used header line and field sepatator

. the "Build dictionary" function now proposes a categorical format for fields 
  that only contain the values "", "0", or "1"
  
. in modeling dictionaries, the target variable is now set as "Unused" by default
  to facilitate the deployment of predictors in the case of deployment databases 
  where the target variable is missing

. the Accidents sample database is now translated into English, with interpretable 
  variable names and values; a simpler version called AccidentsSummary is available
 
. the khiops and khiops_coclustering shell commands now exploit a common shell command
  khiops_env which defines all env variables required by Khiops.
  This new command is self-documented and can be used from a wrapper, such as pykhiops
   
. better messages and documentation in case of unsupported data formats, such as the 
  "classic" Mac OS line endings, deprecated since Max OS X in 1998, or a UTF-8 file
  with BOM (byte order mark) start characters

. slight improvement of the level criterion for the preparation of univariate and
  bivariate data in some edge cases
  
. the "Build coclustering" button is renamed to "Train coclustering" in the Khiops coclustering tool

. the environment variables for managing external resources are now KHIOPS_MEMORY_LIMIT and KHIOPS_TMP_DIR, 
  instead of the now obsolete KhiopsTmpDir.
    
. AUC is now 0 in the case of an empty test database.

. the "Specific test database" dialog is now reset when the test database mode has changed.

. other minor improvements


Issues:
. fix a bug in the "Extract keys" function, when the output file is specified without a header line

. fix an overestimation of the memory requirement for building the trees in the case of large databases

. fix a edge case bug that freezes parallel processes when learning a multi-table scheme

. fix a edge case bug in the SNB classifier, in the case of a very large matrix instances x variables beyond two billion values

. fix a edge case bug in the sorting functionality, when the input files contain fields between double quotes with internal quotes
  double quotes and/or an input field separator, and when the output field separator is different from the input one

. fix a bug in te user interface, when the "Inspect dictionary" action could be called twice simultaneously, resulting in a crash

. fix several resource management issues in the case of a cluster with several heteregeneous machines

. Other minor corrections

  - easy integration in information systems via batch mode, python library and
    online deployment library

Khiops 10.0 - what's new
    - New algorithm for Selective Naive Bayes predictor
        . improved accuracy using a direct optimization of variable weights,
        . improved interpretability and faster deployment time, with less variables selected,
        . faster training time, using the new algorithm and exploiting parallelization,
    - Improved random forests
        . faster and more accurate preprocessing,
        . biased random selection of variable to better deal with large numbers of variables,
    - Management of sparse data
        . fully automatic,
        . potentially faster algorithms in case of many constructed variables,
    - New visualization tool
        . available on any platform: windows, linux, mac, both in standalone and using a browser
    - Parallelization on clusters of machine
        . available on Hadoop (Yarn, HDFS)
    - New version of pykhiops
        . more compliant with python PEP8 standard, using snake case
        . distributed as a python package
        . new features are available: see pykhiops release notes

Upward compatibility with Khiops 9
  - dictionaries of Khiops 9 are readable with Khiops 10
  - visualization reports of Khiops 9 are usable with the former visualization tool
  - python scripts using pykhiops 9 are running, with warnings for the deprecated features
  - scenarios of Khiops 9 are compatible, with warnings for the deprecated features
  - removed features in Khiops 10, that still work when used from former python scripts or scenarios:
    . MAP Naive Bayes is removed
    . Naive Bayes predictor is removed
    . Mandatory variable in pairs
    . Preprocessing options MODLEqualWidth, MODLEqualFrequency and MODLBasic are removed
  - deprecated features, that still work but will be removed in next versions:
    . pykhiops 9 is replaced by pykhiops 10 (see migration guide within pykhiops release notes)
Warning: 
  - all Khiops 9 deprecated features will be removed after Khiops 10, without upward compatibility
  - in future version, compatibility will no longer be maintained at the scenario level:
    it is preferable to use python scripts using pykhiops


Detailed evolutions
===================
Predictor
  . the new SNB algorithm directly optimizes the variable weights instead of computing
    them as a weighted sum over an ensemble of models,
  . the new SNB algorithm selects far less variables than previously
     . the MAP Naive Bayes predictor is no longer available
     . the Naive Bayes predictor is no longer available
  . in the SNB modeling report, each selected variable comes with three indicators
     . level: univariate evaluation
     . weight: multivariate evaluation
     . importance (new indicator): geometric mean of the weight and the level
     . the MAP indicator is no longer available
  . regression: predictors can now deal with missing target values
     . modeling: predictor are trained on the subset of the train database,
       containing the records related to actual target values
     . evaluation: the evaluation criteria are computed using only the
       the records related to actual target values

Management of sparse data:
  . user impacts, in the user interface
    . in the deployment dialog box, the user can choose the output format for the output database:
       . tabular (default): standard tabular format
       . sparse: extended tabular format, with sparse fields in case of sparse data
  . technical impacts, most of them for internal purpose only,
    sparse data is managed throughout the data mining process, 
    from feature construction to model deployment
    . dictionaries: variables can be organized in blocks of sparse variables
    . file format: sparse format is exploited in case of blocks of variables
    . derivation rules: many internal sparse derivation rules have been added
